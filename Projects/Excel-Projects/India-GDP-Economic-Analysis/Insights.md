## ⚠️ Important Analytical Caveat

**Nominal USD GDP Warning**

- Exchange rate movements strongly influence USD-denominated GDP
- Large spikes may reflect currency changes, not pure economic expansion
- Cross-verified using:
  - AMA Exchange Rate
  - IMF Exchange Rate columns

## 📌 Analyst Summary

India's economic trajectory shows clear structural shifts:
- Post-2003 investment-driven expansion
- Temporary resilience during GFC
- Moderation phase mid-2010s
